This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete
info, see http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[John Gruber's
original spec] and the
http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/[Github-flavored
Markdown info page].

This cheatsheet is specifically _Markdown Here's_ version of
Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax
from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from
what you get in a _Markdown Here_ email, but it should be pretty close.

You can play around with Markdown on our
http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html[live demo page].

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

There are two ways to create links.

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself][]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting
isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and _Markdown Here_ --
support syntax highlighting. _Markdown Here_ supports highlighting for
dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP
headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names,
see the
http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html[highlight.js
demo page].

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Inline `+code+` has `+back-ticks around+` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or
are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code
blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

(Github Wiki pages don't seem to support syntax highlighting, so the
above won't be colourful (the strings are not red, for example). Try it
out in a _Markdown Here_ email or a Github Markdown README or Github
Issue -- you can preview a new Issue without submitting it.)

Again, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to
write those language names, see the
http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html[highlight.js
demo page].

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM
and _Markdown Here_ supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables
to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from
another application.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty
well.

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to
experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline),
then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll
soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

....
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but... This line is only
separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same

(Technical note: _Markdown Here_ uses GFM line breaks, so there's no
need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the
video like this:

[source,no-highlight]
----
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
----

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:
