# Static School

Static Shool is an open-source project with the goal of making it easier to discover, research, and (ultimately) choose a static site generator (SSG) for your next project. We try to provide in-depth analysis for all SSGs we cover, including data (updated daily) on activity, popularity, and performance.

This project was inspired by Netlify's MIT-licensed [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) website. The major difference is that *Static School* is much more than a "leaderboard": we provide in-depth benchmarking, guides, and tutorials.
